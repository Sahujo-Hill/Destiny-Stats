This project makes use of Bungie's Destiny api to make a POST request, filter some data, make a GET request using the data from the POST and then display this in a conditional interface with some contrasting design elements. For this project, I wanted to make something more relevant to my own personal likings.<br></br>
### It contains:
- User entry of Username and (gaming) Platform via a dropdown
- Use of backend HTTP requests
- JSON Deserialization
- Parsing data into readable formats
- Exception catching with errors annouced to the user
- Nice mobile view/small screen view
- ---

#### Factors I'm happy with:
- Use of C# in Blazor
- Bindings and mappings within HTML demonstrate an understanding of the two languages integrated via Blazor
- Took something I'm passionate about and built a working, beneficial application
- My first use of api interaction

#### Pain points:
- Had to ask for assistance from another dev with some of the deserialization and property checks due to lack of JSON knowledge
- Jumped into the deep end, could've started with a more simple api interaction

#### What I'd do next:
- Re-order some of the code for clarity
- Continue to develop api skills by adding more requests that display additional data
- Learn about auth keys, this would allow me to make use of PUT requests within the Destiny api
